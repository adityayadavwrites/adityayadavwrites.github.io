      <h1>Memory Lane</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">A standalone short piece</p>

      <article class="story">

        <p>It's so quiet in here, but you're still laughing at my jokes in my head.<br>
        You're still hanging on my lips.<br>
        You're still the one who hugs me and slips a paper ring onto my finger.</p>

        <p>It’s strange — the way I can fly back into our memories while gravity keeps me pinned to this bed, tears streaming down my face for all we could’ve been.</p>

        <p>It’s not like I haven’t moved on at all.<br>
        But for the past three years, you’ve lived rent-free in the corners of my mind.<br>
        Us — our young, silly love.<br>
        Your kisses.<br>
        Your warm blood beating through your arms while I rested my face there.</p>

        <p>Has it really been that long?</p>

        <p>I’ve spent years practicing how I’d act if we ran into each other again.<br>
        Would I scream at you?<br>
        Would I smile and say we made the right choice, that we found people better suited for us?<br>
        Or maybe — just maybe — you’d tell me you were wrong.</p>

        <p>Most days, memories flood me so heavily that I drown before I realize I’m walking the old streets — the park where you held my hand for the first time and my ears went hot, the terrace where we ate ice cream and laughed like we were immortal.</p>

        <p>Then there are moments when a scent hits me — that same perfume you loved — and I swear, I chased a stranger for two blocks just to figure out its name.</p>

        <p>I loved you.<br>
        God, I did.<br>
        And a part of me always will.</p>

        <p>I remember how you used to treasure the letters I wrote you.<br>
        I’ve written hundreds more since you left…<br>
        but you never came back to claim them.</p>

        <p>Even in a room full of people, solitude finds me.<br>
        It sits beside me.<br>
        It crowns me.</p>

        <p>And even though it hurts, I keep walking down memory lane — because that’s the only place I can still touch you.<br>
        Still kiss you.<br>
        Still crumble in your arms.<br>
        The only place where you still love me back.</p>

        <p>It’s nice, isn’t it?<br>
        Loving someone completely.<br>
        Promising the world.<br>
        Believing in a future together.</p>
