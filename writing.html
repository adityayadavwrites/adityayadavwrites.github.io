<h1>Writing</h1>

<p><em>
I write emotionally driven stories with a romantic core, blending
intimacy, longing, and character-first storytelling across
contemporary and fantasy romance.
</em></p>

<h2>Currently Querying</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>In the Booth</strong><br>
    A contemporary romance set in the world of audiobook narration,
    exploring voice, vulnerability, and unexpected intimacy between
    two people sharing a very small soundproof space.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Completed Manuscripts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Sparkbound</strong><br>
    An adult fantasy romance driven by hunger, power, and devotion —
    where desire burns fiercely and nothing can be claimed quietly.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Works in Progress</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Let’s Escape, Babe</strong><br>
    A contemporary romance unfolding during a retreat in Goa,
    centred on proximity, emotional healing, and slow emotional collision.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Projects</h2>

<p>
I am also developing other contemporary, literary, and romantic
projects currently in various stages of exploration and rest.
