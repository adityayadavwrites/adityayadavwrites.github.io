<h1>About Me</h1>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p>
I’m Aditya Yadav, a writer drawn to emotionally grounded stories
with warmth, humour, and the occasional brush of magic.
</p>

<p>
I write contemporary and commercial rom-com–leaning fiction,
often exploring longing, connection, and the quiet moments
where people realise they’re already in love. My work blends softness with emotional tension, centring heartfelt character dynamics and stories that feel comforting, hopeful, and quietly immersive.
</p>

<p>
Across genres — from modern romantic comedies to more emotionally intense love stories — I’m interested in intimacy, timing, and the small, human details that make relationships feel real. Whether set in familiar, everyday spaces or heightened worlds, my stories are driven by character, voice, and emotional payoff.
</p>
<p>
Outside of writing, I'm a medical student. I’m usually working on multiple projects at once, thinking too hard about character arcs, or convincing myself that starting another book is a reasonable idea.
