<h1>About Me</h1>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p>
I’m Aditya Yadav, a writer drawn to emotionally grounded stories
with warmth, humour, and the occasional brush of magic.
</p>

<p>
I write contemporary and commercial rom-com–leaning fiction,
often exploring longing, connection, and the quiet moments
where people realise they’re already in love.
</p>

<p>
My work balances softness with emotional tension, blending
heartfelt character dynamics with stories that feel comforting,
hopeful, and quietly immersive.
</p>
<p>
Outside of writing, I'm a medical student.
