<h1>About Me</h1>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p>
I’m Aditya Yadav, a writer who loves emotionally rich rom-coms,
soft fantasy elements, and stories that feel like a hug
with just enough angst.
</p>

<p>
I write fiction, reflections, and thoughtful book reviews,
often exploring themes of longing, connection, and interiority.

This website is my personal archive — a place for my work,
my reading life, and the ideas I’m still becoming.
