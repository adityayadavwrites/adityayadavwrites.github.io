<h1>Books That Raised My Dopamine</h1>

<p><em>
These books were pure serotonin — fast, fun,
emotionally satisfying, and impossible to put down.
</em></p>

<h3>• Book Title One — Author</h3>
<p>
Why it worked: pacing, banter, and payoff that
scratched exactly the right part of my brain.
</p>

<h3>• Book Title Two — Author</h3>
<p>
Why it worked: high emotional reward with zero drag.
